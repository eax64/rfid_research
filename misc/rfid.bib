abstract = {The MIFARE Classic product from NXP Semiconductors has been much maligned over recent years and whilst some of the criticism is well justified by virtue of the inherent security problems, it is by no means the weakest card/RFID in use today. In this article we give a brief overview of the MIFARE Classic card, its use, design and security. We start by looking at the range of card and RFID products and placing the MIFARE Classic in its intended position. The process of risk assessment is then discussed as a means of choosing " appropriate" products and solutions. We then discuss the history of the MIFARE Classic, its design, security features and associated attacks. The long-lasting effects of the attacks and publicity are considered with respect to not only the MIFARE Classic, but for similar product risk reviews. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
