## sources
##### eavesdrop_ISO14443A/
[eavesdrop.grc](sources/eavesdrop_ISO14443A/eavesdrop.grc)
A GNU Radio code that takes as input an IQ sample generatated by a SDR device and do some signal processing to output a simple to parse file.

[decode.py](sources/eavesdrop_ISO14443A/decode.py)
A Python script that akes the file generated by the eavesdrop.grc and display the raw APDU bytes sent by the reader.

##### ev2_communication/
[ev2.py](sources/ev2_communication/ev2.py)
A python script that send proximity check and verify APDUs to an ev2 card.
This is the distance bounding feature of the EV2 that we want to check.

This script contains some cryptographic algorithm (mostly on the `verify()` function) that are not from me (written by my supervisor).

##### relay_attack/
###### rogue_reader/
[fake_reader.py](sources/relay_attack/rogue_reader/fake_reader.py)
A python script acting as a rogue reader
```
... < - FIFO - > [./fake_reader.py] < - USB - > [(rogue) reader] <- NFC -> [real card]
```

###### tag_emulator/
[Makefile](sources/relay_attack/tag_emulator/Makefile)
Makefile that compiles the next to .c file into executable files.

[emulate.c](sources/relay_attack/tag_emulator/emulate.c)
C code that communicate with a PN532 nfc device to emulate an EV2 card.
```
[legitimate reader] < - NFC - > [tag emulator] < - USB - > [./emulate] < - FIFO - > ...
```

[getinfo.c](sources/relay_attack/tag_emulator/getinfo.c)
C code that get the basic informations from the card to be able to emulate it. (Protocol/etc)


##### scope_instrumentation/
[instrument.py](sources/scope_instrumentation/instrument.py)
This file is from [here](http://www.cibomahto.com/2010/04/controlling-a-rigol-oscilloscope-using-linux-and-python/)

[process.py](sources/scope_instrumentation/process.py)
Python script that takes a numpy file in input and display a graph of this data.

[scope.py](sources/scope_instrumentation/scope.py)
Python script that automate the acquisition of data from the oscilloscope.

###### output/
[checksum_md5.txt](sources/scope_instrumentation/output/checksum_md5.txt)
Md5 of every files in this directory. (Not present on github because too big)
